    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>League setup and rules</h2>
      <p>£30 up front fee to join which covers you for your first 10 competition rounds (£3 entrance fee per round). These can be Saturday, Sunday, or Thursday official club comps, but only singles (Stableford/Medal) comps, not team events.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="payout">
      <h2>Payout Structure</h2>
      <p>After each comp is completed, scores will be collected, and the top 2 players from those league members who have played split 80% of that week’s pot (60/40), with 20% of it going towards a final league winners’ pot.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="scoring">
      <h2>Scoring</h2>
      <p>You score points each time you play in a comp depending on where you place with the other league members who have played, and at the end of the year, a league winner takes the final pot and coveted league champion title.</p>
      <p>For example: If 10 league players play the first Saturday comp = £30 in the pot. £24 goes to the top 2 players (60/40 split) and £6 goes into the final pot.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1st place scores 10 points (based on 10 players playing), 2nd place scores 9 and so on down to last player getting 1 point, so you always score points as long as you play.</li>
        <li>If 15 players play, 1st place gets 15 points, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="credit">
      <h2>Credit & Top‑Ups</h2>
      <p>Money doesn't come off your £30 credit unless you play in a competition. If you don’t use all of your £30 credit during the season, you get your balance back at the end. If you run out of credit, you can top up at any time.</p>
      <p>Weekly prizes can either be taken as cash transferred back to you each week, banked as entry fee credit, or cashed in at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>All money is held in a dedicated league bank account that is not used for any other purpose.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="updates">
      <h2>Weekly Updates</h2>
      <p>An update on winners and league standings will be sent out each week via email.</p>
